/**
 * <p>Concrete FormController implementation that provides configurable
 * form and success views, and an onSubmit chain for convenient overriding.
 * Automatically resubmits to the form view in case of validation errors,
 * and renders the success view in case of a valid submission.</p>
 *
 * <p>The workflow of this Controller does not differ much from the one described
 * in the {@link AbstractFormController AbstractFormController}. The difference
 * is that you do not need to implement {@link #showForm showForm} and
 * {@link #processFormSubmission processFormSubmission}: A form view and a
 * success view can be configured declaratively.</p>
 *
 * <p><b><a name="workflow">Workflow
 * (<a href="AbstractFormController.html#workflow">in addition to the superclass</a>):</b><br>
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Call to {@link #processFormSubmission processFormSubmission} which inspects
 *      the {@link org.springframework.validation.Errors Errors} object to see if
 *      any errors have occurred during binding and validation.</li>
 *  <li>If errors occured, the controller will return the configured formView,
 *      showing the form again (possibly rendering according error messages).</li>
 *  <li>If no errors occurred, the controller will call
 *      {@link #onSubmit(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, Object, BindException) onSubmit()}
 *      using all parameters, which in case of the default implementation
 *      delegates to {@link #onSubmit(Object, BindException) onSubmit()}
 *      with just the command object. The default implementation of the latter
 *      method will return the configured successView.</li>
 *  </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The submit behavior can be customized by overriding one of the
 * {@link #onSubmit onSubmit} methods. Submit actions can also perform
 * custom validation if necessary (typically database-driven checks), calling
 * {@link #showForm(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, BindException) showForm}
 * in case of validation errors to show the form view again.</p>
 *
 * <p><b><a name="config">Exposed configuration properties</a>
 * (<a href="AbstractFormController.html#config">and those defined by superclass</a>):</b><br>

 *      <td>successView</td>
 *      <td><i>null</i></td>
 *      <td>Indicates what view to use when successful form submissions have
 *          occurred. Such a success view could e.g. display a submission summary.
 *          More sophisticated actions can be implemented by overriding one of
 *          the {@link #onSubmit(Object) onSubmit()} methods.</td>
