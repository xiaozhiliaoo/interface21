/** 
 * An interface used by JdbcTemplate for mapping returned result sets.
 * Implementations of this interface perform the actual work of mapping
 * rows, but don't need to worry about exception handling. SQLExceptions
 * will be caught and handled correctly by the JdbcTemplate class.
 *
 * <p>Typically used either for JdbcTemplate's query methods (with
 * RowMapperResultReader adapters) or for out parameters of stored procedures.
 * RowMapper objects are typically stateless and thus reusable; they are
 * ideal choices for implementing row-mapping logic in a single place.
 *
 * <p>Alternatively, consider subclassing MappingSqlQuery from the jdbc.object
 * package: Instead of working with separate JdbcTemplate and RowMapper objects,
 * you can have executable query objects (containing row-mapping logic) there.
