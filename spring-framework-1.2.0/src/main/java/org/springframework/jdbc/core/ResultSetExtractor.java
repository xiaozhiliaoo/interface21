/** 
 * Callback interface used by JdbcTemplate's query methods.
 * Implementations of this interface perform the actual work of extracting
 * results, but don't need to worry about exception handling. SQLExceptions
 * will be caught and handled correctly by the JdbcTemplate class.
 *
 * <p>This interface is mainly used within the JDBC framework.
 * A RowCallbackHandler is usually a simpler choice for ResultSet processing,
 * in particular a RowMapperResultReader in combination with a RowMapper.
 *
 * <p>Note: In contrast to a RowCallbackHandler, a ResultSetExtractor object
 * is typically stateless and thus reusable, as long as it doesn't access
 * stateful resources (like output streams when streaming LOB contents)
 * or keep result state within the object.
