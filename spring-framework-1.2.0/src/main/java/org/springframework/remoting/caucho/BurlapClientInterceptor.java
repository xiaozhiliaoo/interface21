/**
 * Interceptor for accessing a Burlap service.
 * Supports authentication via username and password.
 * The service URL must be an HTTP URL exposing a Burlap service.
 *
 * <p>Burlap is a slim, XML-based RPC protocol.
 * For information on Burlap, see the
 * <a href="http://www.caucho.com/burlap">Burlap website</a>
 *
 * <p>Note: Burlap services accessed with this proxy factory do not
 * have to be exported via BurlapServiceExporter, as there isn't
 * any special handling involved. Therefore, you can also access
 * services that are exported via Caucho's BurlapServlet.
