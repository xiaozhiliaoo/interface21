/**
 * This is the central interface in Spring's transaction infrastructure.
 * Applications can use this directly, but it is not primarily meant as API:
 * Typically, applications will work with either TransactionTemplate or
 * declarative transaction through AOP.
 *
 * <p>For implementors, it is recommended to derive from the provided
 * AbstractPlatformTransactionManager class, which pre-implements the defined
 * propagation behavior and completely handles transaction synchronization.
 * Subclasses have to implement template methods for specific states of the
 * underlying transaction, for example: begin, suspend, resume, commit.
 *
 * <p>The default implementations of this strategy interface are
 * JtaTransactionManager and DataSourceTransactionManager, which can serve
 * as implementation guide for other transaction strategies.
