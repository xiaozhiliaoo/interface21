 * AOP Alliance MethodInterceptor providing declarative transaction

 *
 * <p>Derives from the TransactionAspectSupport class. That class contains
 * the necessary calls into Spring's underlying transaction API:
 * subclasses such as this are responsible for calling superclass methods
 * such as <code>createTransactionIfNecessary</code> in the correct order,
 * in the event of normal invocation return or an exception.
 *
 * <p>TransactionInterceptors are thread-safe.
