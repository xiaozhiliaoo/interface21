/**
 * FactoryBean implementation for use to source AOP proxies from a Spring BeanFactory.
 *
 * <p>Interceptors and Advisors are identified by a list of bean names in the current
 * bean factory. These beans should be of type Interceptor or Advisor. The last entry
 * in the list can be the name of any bean in the factory. If it's neither an
 * Interceptor nor an Advisor, a new SingletonTargetSource is added to wrap it. If it;s
 * a TargetSource, it is used as this proxy factory's TargetSource. It's normally preferred
 * to use the "targetSource" property to set the TargetSource. It is not possible to use
 * both the targetSource property and an interceptor name: this is treated as a
 * configuration error.
 *
 * <p>Global interceptors and advisors can be added at the factory level. The specified
 * ones are expanded in an interceptor list where an "xxx*" entry is included in the
 * list, matching the given prefix with the bean names (e.g. "global*" would match
 * both "globalBean1" and "globalBean2", "*" all defined interceptors). The matching
 * interceptors get applied according to their returned order value, if they
 * implement the Ordered interface. An interceptor name list may not conclude
 * with a global "xxx*" pattern, as global interceptors cannot invoke targets.
 *
 * <p>Creates a J2SE proxy when proxy interfaces are given, a CGLIB proxy for the
 * actual target class if not. Note that the latter will only work if the target class
 * does not have final methods, as a dynamic subclass will be created at runtime.
 *
 * <p>It's possible to cast a proxy obtained from this factory to <code>Advised</code>, or to
 * obtain the ProxyFactoryBean reference and programmatically manipulate it.
 * This won't work for existing prototype references, which are independent. However,
 * it will work for prototypes subsequently obtained from the factory. Changes to
 * interception will work immediately on singletons (including existing references).
 * However, to change interfaces or target it's necessary to obtain a new instance
 * from the factory. This means that singleton instances obtained from the factory
 * do not have the same object identity. However, they do have the same interceptors
 * and target, and changing any reference will change all objects.

	 * Implementation notes. There are two cases of usage of this class:
	 * usage as a singleton, when only one object will be created, and usage
	 * as a prototype, when the FactoryBean.getObject() method must return an 
	 * independent proxy on each invocation. In the latter case, a distinct instance of
	 * any non-singleton Advisors or Advices must be used, as well as a distinct
	 * target/TargetSource instance if the target is a prototype and is specified in the
	 * interceptorNames list, rather than using the target or targetSource property. 
	 * 
	 * If this factory is used as a singleton, the advice chain in this class is used
	 * and all Advisors/Advices are materialized when the singleton instance is created.
	 * If it's a prototype, new AdvisedSupport instances are created with
	 * a copy of the advice chain to create each proxy and support independent
	 * manipulation of advice. Any advisor/advice bean names that that are prototypes
	 * are replaced by placeholders in the advisor chain held in this class and
	 * an independent advisor chain is materialized when each prototype instance
	 * is created.
