/**
 * Convenient implementation of the IntroductionInterceptor interface.

 * <p>Subclasses merely need to extend this class and implement the interfaces
 * to be introduced themselves. In this case the delegate is the subclass
 * instance itself. Alternatively a separate delegate may implement the
 * interface, and be set via the delegate bean property.
 *
 * <p>Delegates or subclasses may implement any number of interfaces.
 * All interfaces except IntroductionInterceptor are picked up from
 * the subclass or delegate by default.
 *
 * <p>The <code>suppressInterface</code> method can be used to suppress interfaces
 * implemented by the delegate but which should not be introduced to the owning
 * AOP proxy.
 * 
 * <p>A DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor is serializable if the delegate is.
