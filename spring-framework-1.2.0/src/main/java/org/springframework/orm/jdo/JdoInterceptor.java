/**
 * This interceptor binds a new JDO PersistenceManager to the thread before a method
 * call, closing and removing it afterwards in case of any method outcome.
 * If there already is a pre-bound PersistenceManager (e.g. from JdoTransactionManager,
 * or from a surrounding JDO-intercepted method), the interceptor simply participates in it.
 *
 * <p>Application code must retrieve a JDO PersistenceManager via the
 * <code>PersistenceManagerFactoryUtils.getPersistenceManager</code> method,
 * to be able to detect a thread-bound PersistenceManager. It is preferable to use
 * <code>getPersistenceManager</code> with allowCreate=false, if the code relies on
 * the interceptor to provide proper PersistenceManager handling. Typically, the code
 * will look as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void doJdoAction() {
 *   PersistenceManager pm = PersistenceManagerFactoryUtils.getPersistenceManager(this.pmf, false);
 *   try {
 *     ...
 *   }
 *   catch (JDOException ex) {
 *     throw PersistenceManagerFactoryUtils.convertJdoAccessException(ex);
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Note that the application must care about handling JDOExceptions itself,
 * preferably via delegating to the <code>PersistenceManagerFactoryUtils.convertJdoAccessException</code>
 * method that converts them to exceptions that are compatible with the
 * <code>org.springframework.dao</code> exception hierarchy (like JdoTemplate does).
 *
 * <p>This interceptor could convert unchecked JDOExceptions to unchecked dao ones
 * on-the-fly. The intercepted method wouldn't have to throw any special checked
 * exceptions to be able to achieve this. Nevertheless, such a mechanism would
 * effectively break the contract of the intercepted method (runtime exceptions
 * can be considered part of the contract too), therefore it isn't supported.
 *
 * <p>This class can be considered a declarative alternative to JdoTemplate's
 * callback approach. The advantages are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>no anonymous classes necessary for callback implementations;
 * <li>the possibility to throw any application exceptions from within data access code.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The drawbacks are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the dependency on interceptor configuration;
 * <li>the delegating try/catch blocks.
 * </ul>
