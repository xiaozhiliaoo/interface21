/**
 * This adapter FactoryBean takes a TopLink SessionFactory and exposes a
 * corresponding transaction-aware TopLink Session as bean reference.
 *
 * <p>This adapter bean will usually be defined in front of a Spring
 * LocalSessionFactoryBean, to allow for passing Session references
 * to DAOs that expect to work on a raw TopLink Session. Your DAOs can
 * then, for example, access the currently active Session and UnitOfWork via
 * <code>Session.getActiveSession</code> and <code>Session.getActiveUnitOfWork</code>,
 * respectively.
 *
 * <p>The main advantage of this proxy is that it allows DAOs to work with a
 * plain TopLink Session reference, while still participating in Spring's
 * (or a J2EE server's) resource and transaction management. DAOs will only
 * rely on the TopLink API in such a scenario, without any Spring dependencies.
 *
 * <p>It is usually preferable to write your TopLink-based DAOs with Spring's
 * TopLinkTemplate, offering benefits such as consistent data access exceptions
 * instead of TopLinkExceptions at the DAO layer. However, Spring's resource
 * and transaction management (and Dependency	Injection) will work for DAOs
 * written against the plain TopLink API too.
 *
 * <p>Of course, you can still access the target TopLink SessionFactory
 * even when your DAOs go through this adapter, by defining a bean reference
 * that points directly at your target SessionFactory bean.
 *
 * <p>Note that the actual creation of a transaction-aware TopLink Session
 * is available on the TopLink SessionFactory itself. This adapter FactoryBean
 * is just a convenient way to expose such a Session in a declarative fashion.
