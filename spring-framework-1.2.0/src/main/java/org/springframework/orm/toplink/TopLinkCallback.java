/**
 * Callback interface for TopLink code. To be used with TopLinkTemplate's execute
 * method, assumably often as anonymous classes within a method implementation.
 * The typical implementation will call TopLink Session CRUD to perform some
 * operations on persistent objects.
 *
 * <p>The Session that is passed into the <code>doInTopLink</code> method is usually
 * a thread-safe ClientSession. Since this provides access to the TopLink shared cache,
 * it is possible for implementations of this interface to return references to
 * <i>read-only objects from the shared cache</i>. These objects <i>must not be modified</i>
 * by application code outside of the DAO layer. If persistent objects need to be edited,
 * then they should be loaded from or registered with a TopLink UnitOfWork, or they should
 * be explicitly copied and merged back into a UnitOfWork at a later time.
 *
 * <p>Users can access a UnitOfWork by using the <code>getActiveUnitOfWork</code> method
 * on the <code>Session</code>. Normally, this will only be done when there is an active
 * non-read-only transaction being managed by Spring's TopLinkTransactionManager or by
 * an external transaction controller (usually a J2EE server's JTA provider, configured
 * in TopLink). <code>getActiveUnitOfWork</code> will return null outside a transaction.

	 * <p>Note that write operations should usually be performed on the active
	 * UnitOfWork within an externally controlled transaction, through calling
