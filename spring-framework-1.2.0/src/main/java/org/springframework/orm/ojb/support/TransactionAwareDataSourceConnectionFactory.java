/**
 * Subclass of LocalDataSourceConnectionFactory that returns transaction-aware
 * proxies for all DataSources retrieved by OJB.
 *
 * <p>Define the following entry in your OJB.properties to use this connection factory:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ConnectionFactoryClass=org.springframework.orm.ojb.support.TransactionAwareDataSourceConnectionFactory</pre>
 *
 * This connection factory allows Spring's OJB access to participate in JDBC-based
 * transactions managed outside of OJB (for example, by Spring's DataSourceTransactionManager).
 * This can be convenient if you need a different local transaction strategy for another O/R
 * mapping tool, for example, but still want OJB access to join into those transactions.
 *
 * <p>A further benefit of this factory is that plain PersistenceBrokers
 * (opened directly via the PersistenceBrokerFactory, outside of Spring's OJB support)
 * will still participate in active Spring-managed transactions.
 *
 * <p>As a further effect, using a transaction-aware DataSource will apply remaining
 * transaction timeouts to all created JDBC Statements. This means that all operations
 * performed by OJB will automatically participate in Spring-managed transaction timeouts.
 * This is even desirable for transactions managed by PersistenceBrokerTransactionManager.
