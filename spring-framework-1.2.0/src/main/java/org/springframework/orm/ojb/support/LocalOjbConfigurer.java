/**
 * This configurer needs to be defined as Spring bean when using
 * LocalDataSourceConnectionFactory, to expose the Spring BeanFactory
 * to the corresponding static field of the connection factory.
 * See LocalDataSourceConnectionFactory's javadoc for usage details.
 *
 * <p>It is clearly not ideal to use a static field here, but unfortunately
 * OJB creates an instance of the configured ConnectionFactory at broker
 * creation time. OJB 1.0 does <i>not</i> have an explicit instance-based
 * configuration model, therefore we have to resort to such workarounds.
