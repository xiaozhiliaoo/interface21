/**
 * The root interface for accessing a Spring bean container.
 * This is the basic client view of a bean container; further interfaces
 * such as <code>ListableBeanFactory</code> and <code>ConfigurableBeanFactory</code>
 * are available for specific purposes.
 *
 * <p>This interface is implemented by objects that hold a number of bean definitions,
 * each uniquely identified by a String name. Depending on the bean definition,
 * the factory will return either an independent instance of a contained object
 * (the Prototype design pattern), or a single shared instance (a superior
 * alternative to the Singleton design pattern, in which the instance is a
 * singleton in the scope of the factory). Which type of instance will be returned
 * depends on the bean factory configuration: the API is the same. The Singleton
 * approach is more useful and more common in practice.
 *
 * <p>The point of this approach is that the BeanFactory is a central registry
 * of application components, and centralizes configuration of application
 * components (no more do individual objects need to read properties files,
 * for example). See chapters 4 and 11 of "Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and
 * Development" for a discussion of the benefits of this approach.
 *
 * <p>Note that it is generally better to rely on Dependency Injection
 * ("push" configuration) to configure application objects through setters
 * or constructors, rather than use any form of "pull" configuration like a
 * BeanFactory lookup. Spring's Dependency Injection functionality is
 * implemented using BeanFactory and its subinterfaces.
 *
 * <p>Normally a BeanFactory will load bean definitions stored in a configuration
 * source (such as an XML document), and use the org.springframework.beans package
 * to configure the beans. However, an implementation could simply return Java
 * objects it creates as necessary directly in Java code. There are no constraints
 * on how the definitions could be stored: LDAP, RDBMS, XML, properties file etc.
 * Implementations are encouraged to support references amongst beans, to either
 * Singletons or Prototypes.
 *
 * <p>In contrast to the methods in ListableBeanFactory, all of the methods in this
 * interface will also check parent factories if this is a HierarchicalBeanFactory.
 * If a bean is not found in this factory instance, the immediate parent is asked.
 * Beans in this factory instance are supposed to override beans of the same name
 * in any parent factory.
 *
 * <p>Bean factory implementations should support the standard bean lifecycle interfaces
 * as far as possible. The maximum set of initialization methods and their standard
 * order is:<br>
 * 1. BeanNameAware's <code>setBeanName</code><br>
 * 2. BeanFactoryAware's <code>setBeanFactory</code><br>
 * 3. ResourceLoaderAware's <code>setResourceLoader</code>
 * (only applicable when running in an application context)<br>
 * 4. ApplicationEventPublisherAware's <code>setApplicationEventPublisher</code>
 * (only applicable when running in an application context)<br>
 * 5. MessageSourceAware's <code>setMessageSource</code>
 * (only applicable when running in an application context)<br>
 * 6. ApplicationContextAware's <code>setApplicationContext</code>
 * (only applicable when running in an application context)<br>
 * 7. ServletContextAware's <code>setServletContext</code>
 * (only applicable when running in a web application context)<br>
 * 8. <code>postProcessBeforeInitialization</code> methods of BeanPostProcessors<br>
 * 9. InitializingBean's <code>afterPropertiesSet</code><br>
 * 10. a custom init-method definition<br>
 * 11. <code>postProcessAfterInitialization</code> methods of BeanPostProcessors
 *
 * <p>On shutdown of a bean factory, the following lifecycle methods apply:<br>
 * 1. DisposableBean's <code>destroy</code><br>
 * 2. a custom destroy-method definition
