 * Interface to be implemented by objects used within a BeanFactory
 * that are themselves factories. If a bean implements this interface,
 * it is used as a factory, not directly as a bean.
 *
 * <p><b>NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used
 * as a normal bean.</b> A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style,
 * but the object exposed for bean references is always the object
 * that it creates.
 *
 * <p>FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can
 * either create objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup.
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily used within the framework, for
 * example for the AOP ProxyFactoryBean or JndiObjectFactoryBean.
 * It can be used for application components, but this is not common
 * outside of infrastructure code.
