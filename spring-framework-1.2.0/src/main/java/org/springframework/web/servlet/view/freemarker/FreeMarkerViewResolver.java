 * Convenience subclass of UrlBasedViewResolver that supports FreeMarkerView

 * <p>The view class for all views generated by this resolver can be specified
 * via setViewClass. See UrlBasedViewResolver's javadocs for details.
 *
 * <p>Note: When chaining ViewResolvers, a FreeMarkerViewResolver always needs
 * to be last, as it will attempt to resolve any view name, no matter whether
 * the underlying resource actually exists.
